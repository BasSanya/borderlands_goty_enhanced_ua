You hereby waive and agree never to assert any moral rights of paternity, publication, reputation, or attribution with respect to Licensor's and other players' use and enjoyment of such assets in connection with the Software and related goods and services under applicable law. This license grant to Licensor, and terms above regarding any applicable moral rights, will survive any termination of this Agreement.\nINTERNET CONNECTION: The Software may require an internet connection to access internet-based features, authenticate the Software, or perform other functions.\nUSER ACCOUNTS: In order to use the Software or a software feature, or for certain features of the Software to operate properly, you may be required to have and maintain a valid and active user account with an online service, such as a third-party gaming platform or social network account ("Third-Party Account"), or an account with Licensor or a Licensor affiliate, as set forth in the Software documentation. If you do not maintain such accounts, then certain features of the Software may not operate or may cease to function properly, either in whole or in part. The Software may also require you to create a Software-specific user account with Licensor or a Licensor affiliate ("User Account") in order to access the Software and its functionality and features. Your User Account log-in may be associated with a Third-Party Account. You are responsible for all use and the security of your User Accounts and any Third-Party Accounts that you use to access and use the Software.\nVIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS\nIf the Software allows you to purchase and/or earn through play a license to use Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, the following additional terms and conditions apply.\nVIRTUAL CURRENCY & VIRTUAL GOODS: The Software may enable users to (i) use fictional virtual currency as a medium of exchange exclusively within the Software ("Virtual Currency" or "VC") and (ii) gain access to (and certain limited rights to use) virtual goods within the Software ("Virtual Goods" or "VG"). Regardless of the terminology used, VC and VG represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement. Subject to the terms of and compliance with this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants you the nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use VC and VG obtained by you for your personal, non-commercial gameplay exclusively within the Software. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, VC and VG obtained by you are licensed to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to VC and VG is being transferred or assigned hereunder. This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in VC and VG.\nVC and VG do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency. You acknowledge and agree that Licensor may revise or take action that impacts the perceived value of or purchase price for any VC and/or VG at any time except as prohibited by applicable law. VC and VG do not incur fees for non-use; provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to VC and VG will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Software documentation, when Licensor ceases providing the Software, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated. Licensor, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use VC or VG and/or may distribute VC or VG with or without charge.\nEARNING & PURCHASING VIRTUAL CURRENCY & VIRTUAL GOODS: You may have the ability to purchase VC or to earn VC from Licensor for the completion of certain activities or accomplishments in the Software. For example, Licensor may provide VC or VG upon the completion of an in-game activity, such as attaining a new level, completing a task, or creating user content. Once obtained, VC and/or VG will be credited to your User Account. You may purchase VC and VG only within the Software, or through a platform, participating third-party online store, application store, or other store authorized by Licensor (all referred to herein as "Software Store"). Purchase and use of in-game items or currency through a Software Store are subject to the Software Store's governing documents, including but not limited to, the Terms of Service and User Agreement. This online service has been sublicensed to you by the Software Store. Licensor may offer discounts or promotions on the purchase of VC, and such discounts and promotions may be modified or discontinued by Licensor at any time without notice to you. Upon completing an authorized purchase of VC from an Application Store, the amount of purchased VC will be credited to your User Account. The Licensor shall establish a maximum amount you may spend to purchase VC per transaction and/or per day, which may vary depending on the associated Software. Licensor, in its sole discretion, may impose additional limits on the amount of VC you may purchase or use, how you may use VC, and the maximum balance of VC that may be credited to your User Account. You are solely responsible for all VC purchases made through your User Account regardless of whether or not authorized by you.\nBALANCE CALCULATION: You can access and view your available VC and VG in your User Account when logged into your User Account. Licensor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make all calculations regarding the available VC and VG in your User Account. Licensor further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the amount of and manner in which VC is credited and debited from your User Account in connection with your purchase of VG or for other purposes. While Licensor strives to make all such calculations on a consistent and reasonable basis, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Licensor's determination of the available VC and VG in your User Account is final, unless you can provide documentation to Licensor that such calculation was or is intentionally incorrect.\nUSING VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS: All purchased in-game Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods may be consumed or lost by players in the course of gameplay according to the game's rules applicable to currency and goods, which may vary depending on the associated Software. VC and VG may only be used within the Software, and Licensor, in its sole discretion, may limit use of VC and/or VG to a single game. The authorized uses and purposes of VC and VG may change at any time. Your available VC and/or VG as shown in your User Account will be reduced each time you use VC and/or VG within the Software. The use of any VC and/or VG constitutes a demand against and withdrawal from your available VC and/or VG in your User Account. You must have sufficient available VC and/or VG in your User Account in order to complete a transaction within the Software. VC and/or VG in your User Account may be reduced without notice upon the occurrence of certain events related to your use of the Software: For example, you may lose VC or VG upon the loss of a game or the death of your character. You are responsible for all uses of VC and/or VG made through your User Account, regardless of whether or not authorized by you. You must notify Licensor immediately upon discovering the unauthorized use of any VC and/or VG made through your User Account by submitting a support request at www.take2games.com/support or, for Social Point products, at www.socialpoint.es/community/#support.\nNON-REDEEMABLE: VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods and services. You may not sell, lease, license, or rent VC or VG, convert them into convertible VC. VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods or services and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value or other goods from Licensor or any other person or entity at any time, except as expressly provided herein or otherwise required by applicable law. VC and VG have no cash value, and neither Licensor nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange your VC or VG for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency.\nNO REFUND: All purchases of VC and VG are final and under no circumstances will such purchases be refundable, transferable, or exchangeable. Except as prohibited by applicable law, Licensor has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify, suspend, and/or eliminate such VC and/or VG as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and Licensor shall have no liability to you or anyone else for the exercise of such rights.\nNO TRANSFERS: Any transferring, trading, selling, or exchanging of any VC or VG to anyone, other than in game play using the Software as expressly authorized by Licensor ("Unauthorized Transactions"), including, but not limited to, among other users of the Software, is not sanctioned by Licensor and is strictly forbidden. Licensor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, or modify your User Account and your VC and VG and terminate this Agreement if you engage in, assist in, or request any Unauthorized Transactions. All users who participate in such activities do so at their own risk and hereby agree to be responsible and liable to Licensor, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents for all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from such actions. You acknowledge that Licensor may request that the applicable Application Store stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue, or reverse any Unauthorized Transaction, regardless of when such Unauthorized Transaction occurred (or has yet to occur) when it suspects or has evidence of fraud, violations of this Agreement, violations of any applicable law or regulation, or any intentional act designed to interfere or that otherwise has the effect of or may have the effect of intervening in any way with the operation of the Software. If we believe or have any reason to suspect that you have engaged in an Unauthorized Transaction, you further agree that Licensor may, in its sole discretion, restrict your access to your available VC and VG in your User Account or terminate or suspend your User Account and your rights to any VC, VG, and other items associated with your User Account.\nLOCATION: VC is only available to customers in certain locations. You may not purchase or use VC if you are not in an approved location.\nSOFTWARE STORE TERMS\nThis Agreement and the provision of the Software through any Software Store (including the purchase of VC or VG) is subject to the additional terms and conditions set forth on or in or required by the applicable Software Store and all such applicable terms and conditions are incorporated herein by this reference. Licensor is not responsible or liable to you for any credit card or bank-related charges or other charges or fees related to your purchase transactions within the Software or through a Software Store. All such transactions are administered by the Software Store, not Licensor. Licensor expressly disclaims any liability for any such transactions, and you agree that your sole remedy regarding all transactions is from or through such Software Store.\nThis Agreement is solely between you and Licensor, and not with any Software Store. You acknowledge that the Software Store has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services to you in connection with the Software. Except for the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Software Store will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Software. Any claim in connection with the Software related to product liability, a failure to conform to applicable legal or regulatory requirements, claims under consumer protection or similar legislation or intellectual property infringement are governed by this Agreement, and the Software Store is not responsible for such claims. You must comply with the Software Store Terms of Service and any other Software Store applicable rules or policies. The license to the Software is a non-transferable license to use the Software only on an applicable device that you own or control. You represent that you are not located in any U.S.-embargoed countries or other geographical areas or on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person's list or Entity List.

Licensor warrants to you that the Software is compatible with a personal computer meeting the minimum system requirements listed in the Software documentation or that it has been certified by the gaming unit producer as compatible with the gaming unit for which it has been published.

No oral or written statement or advice provided by Licensor or any authorized representative shall create a warranty. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.\nIf for any reason you find a defect in the storage medium or Software during the warranty period, Licensor agrees to replace, free of charge, any Software discovered to be defective within the warranty period as long as the Software is currently being manufactured by Licensor. If the Software is no longer available, Licensor retains the right to substitute a similar piece of Software of equal or greater value. This warranty is limited to the storage medium and the Software as originally provided by Licensor and is not applicable to normal wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect. Any implied warranties prescribed by statute are expressly limited to the 90-day period described above.\nExcept as set forth above, and provided that if you are a resident of an EU member state Licensor warrants that the Software will be fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality, this warranty is in lieu of all other warranties, whether oral or written, express or implied, including any other warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement, and no other representations or warranties of any kind shall be binding on Licensor.\nWhen returning the Software subject to the limited warranty above, please send the original Software only to Licensor address specified below and include: your name and return address; a photocopy of your dated sales receipt; and a brief note describing the defect and the system on which you are running the Software.\nYOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO LICENSOR\nTo the fullest extent of applicable law, you agree to be responsible and liable to Licensor, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents in respect of all damages, losses, and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your acts and omissions to act in using the Software pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE, OR MALFUNCTION OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR LOST PROFITS OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This Agreement automatically terminates when Licensor ceases to operate the Software servers (for games exclusively operated online), if Licensor determines or believes your use of the Software involves or may involve fraud or money laundering or any other illicit activity, or upon your failure to comply with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the License Conditions above. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by (i) requesting Licensor to terminate and delete your User Account that is used to access or use the Software using the method set forth in the Terms of Service or (ii) destroying and/or deleting any and all copies of all Software in your possession, custody, or control.

You hereby waive and agree never to assert any moral rights of paternity, publication, reputation, or attribution with respect to Licensor's and other players' use and enjoyment of such assets in connection with the Software and related goods and services under applicable law. This license grant to Licensor, and terms above regarding any applicable moral rights, will survive any termination of this Agreement.\nINTERNET CONNECTION: The Software may require an internet connection to access internet-based features, authenticate the Software, or perform other functions.\nUSER ACCOUNTS: In order to use the Software or a software feature, or for certain features of the Software to operate properly, you may be required to have and maintain a valid and active user account with an online service, such as a third-party gaming platform or social network account ("Third-Party Account"), or an account with Licensor or a Licensor affiliate, as set forth in the Software documentation. If you do not maintain such accounts, then certain features of the Software may not operate or may cease to function properly, either in whole or in part. The Software may also require you to create a Software-specific user account with Licensor or a Licensor affiliate ("User Account") in order to access the Software and its functionality and features. Your User Account log-in may be associated with a Third-Party Account. You are responsible for all use and the security of your User Accounts and any Third-Party Accounts that you use to access and use the Software.\nVIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS\nIf the Software allows you to purchase and/or earn through play a license to use Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, the following additional terms and conditions apply.\nVIRTUAL CURRENCY & VIRTUAL GOODS: The Software may enable users to (i) use fictional virtual currency as a medium of exchange exclusively within the Software ("Virtual Currency" or "VC") and (ii) gain access to (and certain limited rights to use) virtual goods within the Software ("Virtual Goods" or "VG"). Regardless of the terminology used, VC and VG represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement. Subject to the terms of and compliance with this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants you the nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use VC and VG obtained by you for your personal, non-commercial gameplay exclusively within the Software. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, VC and VG obtained by you are licensed to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to VC and VG is being transferred or assigned hereunder. This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in VC and VG.\nVC and VG do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency. You acknowledge and agree that Licensor may revise or take action that impacts the perceived value of or purchase price for any VC and/or VG at any time except as prohibited by applicable law. VC and VG do not incur fees for non-use; provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to VC and VG will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Software documentation, when Licensor ceases providing the Software, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated. Licensor, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use VC or VG and/or may distribute VC or VG with or without charge.\nEARNING & PURCHASING VIRTUAL CURRENCY & VIRTUAL GOODS: You may have the ability to purchase VC or to earn VC from Licensor for the completion of certain activities or accomplishments in the Software. For example, Licensor may provide VC or VG upon the completion of an in-game activity, such as attaining a new level, completing a task, or creating user content. Once obtained, VC and/or VG will be credited to your User Account. You may purchase VC and VG only within the Software, or through a platform, participating third-party online store, application store, or other store authorized by Licensor (all referred to herein as "Software Store"). Purchase and use of in-game items or currency through a Software Store are subject to the Software Store's governing documents, including but not limited to, the Terms of Service and User Agreement. This online service has been sublicensed to you by the Software Store. Licensor may offer discounts or promotions on the purchase of VC, and such discounts and promotions may be modified or discontinued by Licensor at any time without notice to you. Upon completing an authorized purchase of VC from an Application Store, the amount of purchased VC will be credited to your User Account. The Licensor shall establish a maximum amount you may spend to purchase VC per transaction and/or per day, which may vary depending on the associated Software. Licensor, in its sole discretion, may impose additional limits on the amount of VC you may purchase or use, how you may use VC, and the maximum balance of VC that may be credited to your User Account. You are solely responsible for all VC purchases made through your User Account regardless of whether or not authorized by you.\nBALANCE CALCULATION: You can access and view your available VC and VG in your User Account when logged into your User Account. Licensor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make all calculations regarding the available VC and VG in your User Account. Licensor further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the amount of and manner in which VC is credited and debited from your User Account in connection with your purchase of VG or for other purposes. While Licensor strives to make all such calculations on a consistent and reasonable basis, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Licensor's determination of the available VC and VG in your User Account is final, unless you can provide documentation to Licensor that such calculation was or is intentionally incorrect.\nUSING VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS: All purchased in-game Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods may be consumed or lost by players in the course of gameplay according to the game's rules applicable to currency and goods, which may vary depending on the associated Software. VC and VG may only be used within the Software, and Licensor, in its sole discretion, may limit use of VC and/or VG to a single game. The authorized uses and purposes of VC and VG may change at any time. Your available VC and/or VG as shown in your User Account will be reduced each time you use VC and/or VG within the Software. The use of any VC and/or VG constitutes a demand against and withdrawal from your available VC and/or VG in your User Account. You must have sufficient available VC and/or VG in your User Account in order to complete a transaction within the Software. VC and/or VG in your User Account may be reduced without notice upon the occurrence of certain events related to your use of the Software: For example, you may lose VC or VG upon the loss of a game or the death of your character. You are responsible for all uses of VC and/or VG made through your User Account, regardless of whether or not authorized by you. You must notify Licensor immediately upon discovering the unauthorized use of any VC and/or VG made through your User Account by submitting a support request at www.take2games.com/support or, for Social Point products, at www.socialpoint.es/community/#support.\nNON-REDEEMABLE: VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods and services. You may not sell, lease, license, or rent VC or VG, convert them into convertible VC. VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods or services and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value or other goods from Licensor or any other person or entity at any time, except as expressly provided herein or otherwise required by applicable law. VC and VG have no cash value, and neither Licensor nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange your VC or VG for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency.\nNO REFUND: All purchases of VC and VG are final and under no circumstances will such purchases be refundable, transferable, or exchangeable. Except as prohibited by applicable law, Licensor has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify, suspend, and/or eliminate such VC and/or VG as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and Licensor shall have no liability to you or anyone else for the exercise of such rights.\nNO TRANSFERS: Any transferring, trading, selling, or exchanging of any VC or VG to anyone, other than in game play using the Software as expressly authorized by Licensor ("Unauthorized Transactions"), including, but not limited to, among other users of the Software, is not sanctioned by Licensor and is strictly forbidden. Licensor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, or modify your User Account and your VC and VG and terminate this Agreement if you engage in, assist in, or request any Unauthorized Transactions. All users who participate in such activities do so at their own risk and hereby agree to be responsible and liable to Licensor, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents for all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from such actions. You acknowledge that Licensor may request that the applicable Application Store stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue, or reverse any Unauthorized Transaction, regardless of when such Unauthorized Transaction occurred (or has yet to occur) when it suspects or has evidence of fraud, violations of this Agreement, violations of any applicable law or regulation, or any intentional act designed to interfere or that otherwise has the effect of or may have the effect of intervening in any way with the operation of the Software. If we believe or have any reason to suspect that you have engaged in an Unauthorized Transaction, you further agree that Licensor may, in its sole discretion, restrict your access to your available VC and VG in your User Account or terminate or suspend your User Account and your rights to any VC, VG, and other items associated with your User Account.\nLOCATION: VC is only available to customers in certain locations. You may not purchase or use VC if you are not in an approved location.\nSOFTWARE STORE TERMS\nThis Agreement and the provision of the Software through any Software Store (including the purchase of VC or VG) is subject to the additional terms and conditions set forth on or in or required by the applicable Software Store and all such applicable terms and conditions are incorporated herein by this reference. Licensor is not responsible or liable to you for any credit card or bank-related charges or other charges or fees related to your purchase transactions within the Software or through a Software Store. All such transactions are administered by the Software Store, not Licensor. Licensor expressly disclaims any liability for any such transactions, and you agree that your sole remedy regarding all transactions is from or through such Software Store.\nThis Agreement is solely between you and Licensor, and not with any Software Store. You acknowledge that the Software Store has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services to you in connection with the Software. Except for the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Software Store will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Software. Any claim in connection with the Software related to product liability, a failure to conform to applicable legal or regulatory requirements, claims under consumer protection or similar legislation or intellectual property infringement are governed by this Agreement, and the Software Store is not responsible for such claims. You must comply with the Software Store Terms of Service and any other Software Store applicable rules or policies. The license to the Software is a non-transferable license to use the Software only on an applicable device that you own or control. You represent that you are not located in any U.S.-embargoed countries or other geographical areas or on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person's list or Entity List.

Licensor warrants to you that the Software is compatible with a personal computer meeting the minimum system requirements listed in the Software documentation or that it has been certified by the gaming unit producer as compatible with the gaming unit for which it has been published.

If the Software is no longer available, Licensor retains the right to substitute a similar piece of Software of equal or greater value. This warranty is limited to the storage medium and the Software as originally provided by Licensor and is not applicable to normal wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect. Any implied warranties prescribed by statute are expressly limited to the 90-day period described above.\nExcept as set forth above, and provided that if you are a resident of an EU member state Licensor warrants that the Software will be fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality, this warranty is in lieu of all other warranties, whether oral or written, express or implied, including any other warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement, and no other representations or warranties of any kind shall be binding on Licensor.\nWhen returning the Software subject to the limited warranty above, please send the original Software only to Licensor address specified below and include: your name and return address; a photocopy of your dated sales receipt; and a brief note describing the defect and the system on which you are running the Software.\nYOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO LICENSOR\nTo the fullest extent of applicable law, you agree to be responsible and liable to Licensor, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents in respect of all damages, losses, and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your acts and omissions to act in using the Software pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE, OR MALFUNCTION OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR LOST PROFITS OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This Agreement automatically terminates when Licensor ceases to operate the Software servers (for games exclusively operated online), if Licensor determines or believes your use of the Software involves or may involve fraud or money laundering or any other illicit activity, or upon your failure to comply with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the License Conditions above. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by (i) requesting Licensor to terminate and delete your User Account that is used to access or use the Software using the method set forth in the Terms of Service or (ii) destroying and/or deleting any and all copies of all Software in your possession, custody, or control. Deleting the Software from your Game Platform will not delete the information associated with your User Account, including any VC and VG associated with your User Account. If you reinstall the Software using the same User Account, then you may still have access to your prior User Account information, including any VC and VG associated with your User Account. However except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, if your User Account is deleted upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all VC and/or VG associated with your User Account will also be deleted, and you will no longer be available for use the Software or any VC or VG associated with your User Account.

For example, if you purchase virtual currency through a gaming console service, that gaming console service will provide us with information to effectuate the transaction, including the amount of virtual currency purchased and a means to identify your Online Service account. \n\nWhen you use an application on a Social Networking Site ("SNS"), you allow us to access certain information from your profile from that SNS. The information you allow us to access is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS. For example, our Facebook applications may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences: your "basic information" you have shared with everyone on the SNS; your profile picture or its URL; your friends list, your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo; or other information indicated as part of the "Request for Permission" prompt from the SNS. Your agreement to share this information takes place when you "accept" (or similar terms) one of our applications on an SNS. Once your information is received from an SNS, that information is stored and used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Company is not responsible for the terms, policies, disclosures or actions of any SNS. \n\nWhen you use Facebook Connect, OpenID or another multisite ID to log in to an Online Service, those ID services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us to pre-populate our sign up form. Depending on your account settings, multisite IDs may also provide other information to us. Please check the terms of those services before using them to log into an Online Service. When you play certain software products published by the Company, information about your gameplay may be collected and transmitted to the Company through network services or any other internet connection method used by the hardware on which you play such games (collectively and individually your "Internet Connection"). See "What Gameplay Information Does the Company Collect?" below for further details.\nWHAT GAMEPLAY INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT?\nWhen you use products or services on internet-capable hardware, the Company may receive information regarding your gameplay without any additional notice to you or actions taken by you. The Company will not receive personal information such as your name and address, but may receive other information such as a console ID, gaming service ID, game achievements, game scores and performance, IP address, MAC address, or other device ID, other console/device use information, or other information and statistics regarding your usage of the games. Information about gameplay may be collected while you are offline and transmitted to the Company when you next connect to the Internet whether or not you are currently logged into your Internet Connection from your console, handheld, mobile device, computer, or other gaming platform.

Certain membership information may be transferred automatically to the Company when you register to join an Online Service from a third-party gaming network system or link your Online Service membership with a third-party service, such as your friends list on that gaming network or social network service. \n\nPublic Information Including Message Boards, User Generated Content, Forums, News Blogs, Comments, User Profiles and Chat Rooms: Whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on a message board, chat room, comment field, or profile page, that information can be collected and used by other people.

You may also prevent Flash cookies from being placed by adjusting your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com. \n\nWeb Beacons: A "web beacon" is an electronic image that allows websites to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. \n\nInternet Log Files: The Company may also keep track of IP addresses used to access its Online Services for various reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by a networked device and will identify your point of connection to the internet. Depending on your network configuration, it may also identify your computer, or other device. A MAC address or other device ID identifies one specific piece of hardware. These log files are tied to your personal information in certain circumstances, such as if you have linked your console user account to Online Service accounts offered by the Company. \n\nAnalytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies: Other information that may be passively collected by the Company includes log files that record information about your hardware, product use, service use, or website use, including website navigation and game telemetry activity.

The Company uses this information to send you promotional materials, to provide you with access to our services, to fulfill product orders, to fulfill "tell a friend" requests, and to respond to questions or technical problems. We also use your personal and other information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. \n\nYour participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings, and achievements) generated through your participation. \n\nUsers of certain Online Services, such as the Rockstar Games Social Club or my2K, may be automatically entered into contests as a result of their membership and/or use of certain services. Check www.rockstargames.com/socialclub/events frequently for details regarding contests. \n\nOnline gaming and Social Networking Services are by their very nature open communities where gameplay information including user name, game activity, and leaderboard rankings are publicly posted for other people to see. Therefore, the Company will automatically post certain information, such as your Screen Name or ID and gameplay statistics, within the game, on Social Networking Services, on Online Services, or on specialized game websites. However, we will not post information that we know directly identifies you (such as your real name or email address) unless you provide that information voluntarily for such use. As with other gameplay information services, your gameplay, leaderboards, and multiplayer match information may appear nested in our games or third-party webpages via frames or widgets. \n\nWe may match and/or combine information collected in connection with various Online Services and display it publicly, including on our websites, in our games, or in multiplayer game lobbies. For example, if you associate your Company website account with a game console account, your in-game achievements may be displayed combining your website account name with your in-game achievements. \n\nSome of our Online Services allow you to link your account to SNS services like Facebook and Twitter. Certain membership information may be transferred automatically to the Company when you link your Online Service membership with SNS account, such as your friends list. Some SNS services also give you the option to post information about the Online Services to their websites to share with others. If you choose to use these features, your actions are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature. Please review each company's governing policies before using their services. \n\nSome of our Online Services offer SNS features and Widgets, such as the Facebook "Like" button, Google + button, or the Share This button.

SNS features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly by our Online Services. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the Feature.

These vendors provide internal support to the Company by operating some of the services we provide you such as contest entry collection and email services. Although these vendors, not the Company, may collect, use, or maintain the information in connection with the Online Services, the Company still requires that they adhere to the Company's stated privacy policies and that they not share your personal information with third parties or use the information for their own marketing purposes.\nWITH WHOM DOES THE COMPANY SHARE MY INFORMATION?\nThe Company may also share your personal information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. The Company may share your personal information to fulfill a request you have made, such as signing up for an email list or requesting customer support. In the event we offer services or promotions where your personal information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. In addition, we may share aggregate and other information regarding Online Service usage statistics and user demographics with third parties. \n\nWe may share your personal and other information with third parties in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability, including as required by law enforcement or other government officials.

When you play certain software products published by the Company, information about your gameplay may be collected and transmitted to the Company through network services or any other internet connection method used by the hardware on which you play such games (collectively and individually your "Internet Connection"). See "What Gameplay Information Does the Company Collect?" below for further details.\nWHAT GAMEPLAY INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT?\nWhen you use products or services on internet-capable hardware, the Company may receive information regarding your gameplay without any additional notice to you or actions taken by you. The Company will not receive personal information such as your name and address, but may receive other information such as a console ID, gaming service ID, game achievements, game scores and performance, IP address, MAC address, or other device ID, other console/device use information, or other information and statistics regarding your usage of the games.

Certain membership information may be transferred automatically to the Company when you register to join an Online Service from a third-party gaming network system or link your Online Service membership with a third-party service, such as your friends list on that gaming network or social network service. \n\nPublic Information Including Message Boards, User Generated Content, Forums, News Blogs, Comments, User Profiles and Chat Rooms: Whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on a message board, chat room, comment field, or profile page, that information can be collected and used by other people.

An IP address is a number that is used by a networked device and will identify your point of connection to the internet. Depending on your network configuration, it may also identify your computer, or other device. A MAC address or other device ID identifies one specific piece of hardware.

The Company uses this information to send you promotional materials, to provide you with access to our services, to fulfill product orders, to fulfill "tell a friend" requests, and to respond to questions or technical problems. We also use your personal and other information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. \n\nYour participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings, and achievements) generated through your participation. \n\nUsers of certain Online Services, such as the Rockstar Games Social Club or my2K, may be automatically entered into contests as a result of their membership and/or use of certain services. Check www.rockstargames.com/socialclub/events frequently for details regarding contests. \n\nOnline gaming and Social Networking Services are by their very nature open communities where gameplay information including user name, game activity, and leaderboard rankings are publicly posted for other people to see. Therefore, the Company will automatically post certain information, such as your Screen Name or ID and gameplay statistics, within the game, on Social Networking Services, on Online Services, or on specialized game websites. However, we will not post information that we know directly identifies you (such as your real name or email address) unless you provide that information voluntarily for such use. As with other gameplay information services, your gameplay, leaderboards, and multiplayer match information may appear nested in our games or third-party webpages via frames or widgets. \n\nWe may match and/or combine information collected in connection with various Online Services and display it publicly, including on our websites, in our games, or in multiplayer game lobbies. For example, if you associate your Company website account with a game console account, your in-game achievements may be displayed combining your website account name with your in-game achievements. \n\nSome of our Online Services allow you to link your account to SNS services like Facebook and Twitter. Certain membership information may be transferred automatically to the Company when you link your Online Service membership with SNS account, such as your friends list. Some SNS services also give you the option to post information about the Online Services to their websites to share with others. If you choose to use these features, your actions are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature. Please review each company's governing policies before using their services. \n\nSome of our Online Services offer SNS features and Widgets, such as the Facebook "Like" button, Google + button, or the Share This button.

Although these vendors, not the Company, may collect, use, or maintain the information in connection with the Online Services, the Company still requires that they adhere to the Company's stated privacy policies and that they not share your personal information with third parties or use the information for their own marketing purposes.\nWITH WHOM DOES THE COMPANY SHARE MY INFORMATION?\nThe Company may also share your personal information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. The Company may share your personal information to fulfill a request you have made, such as signing up for an email list or requesting customer support. In the event we offer services or promotions where your personal information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. In addition, we may share aggregate and other information regarding Online Service usage statistics and user demographics with third parties. \n\nWe may share your personal and other information with third parties in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability, including as required by law enforcement or other government officials.

Certain Online Services may be directed to an audience of all ages, including children under 13 years old (or older, if applicable law provides for different protections). For these Online Services, the Company may restrict the collection of personal information on the Online Service from anyone or apply an age gate allowing children to use the Online Service but restricting the collection of personal information on the Online Service from children.

The Company has security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Personal information collected by the Company is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public (e.g., locked rooms). To prevent unauthorized electronic access to personal information, the Company maintains information collected online behind a firewall-protected server and uses SSL encryption for purchases made through our online store. However, no system can be 100% secure and human errors occur, so there is the possibility that there could be unauthorized access to your information. By using our services, you assume this risk.\nYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS\nSince 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
